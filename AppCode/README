Hello,

As of 3/23/21, app fully works.

To upload it to github I had to remove node_modules. Thus to run it in VS Code you must run "npm install" to install node_modules.
Will NOT run otherwise.

Still not working?

Answer #14 is how you refresh the package.json file which may give you an error when it mismatches my uploaded package.json
